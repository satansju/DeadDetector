# DeadDetector: A Tool For Detecting Deadlocks in Linear Time
This Project is a part of a bachelor thesis on dynamic deadlock detection.
It uses a partial order named Deadlock Dependence Precedence (DDP) and a deadlock pattern detection mechanism to identify deadlocks.

DeadDetector uses a vector clock algorithm for storing vector clocks of events from a trace in .std-file format.
